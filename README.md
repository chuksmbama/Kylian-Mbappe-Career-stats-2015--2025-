## Project Overview
This project analyses Kylian Mbappe’s performance from 2015 to 2025. I scraped the data directly from the web, cleaned it and shaped it for analysis, then loaded everything into Power BI to build an interactive report. The dashboard tracks key metrics like matches played, minutes, goals, assists, penalties and season-by-season performance. It also highlights his top seasons and provides a simple bio section for context.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data was sourced directly from a trusted sports website, www.statmuse.com, via web scraping, ensuring up-to-date, accurate information.
- cleaned the data for analysis

## Data Visualization
- Built KPI cards highlighting Mbappe’s total matches, starts, minutes played, goals and assists.
- Designed a time-series view to track how his goals and assists have changed over the years.
- Created a column chart showing goals and assists for each season.
- Created a bar chart ranking his top five seasons based on total goal contributions.

## Insights
- Mbappe’s peak began after his move from Monaco to PSG, where his combined goals and assists jumped by 90.48%
- His year-to-year numbers show steady consistency and clear growth in overall performance
- His goal contributions rise in seasons where he plays more minutes and starts more matches
- Mbappe has played an average of 1,856 minutes per year. This shows he is an important player in his team's lineups.

## Summary
The career statistics for Kylian Mbappé from 2015 to 2025 paint the picture of a player who delivers impact every season. He has already stacked up nearly 300 games, more than 22,000 minutes and well over 300 goal contributions. His move from Monaco to a bigger stage didn’t slow him down. It accelerated everything. His output shot up and kept rising year after year.

The dashboard shows a clear pattern. More minutes. More responsibility. More end product. His best seasons are happening right now, not in the past, which tells you he’s still climbing.

He’s young, consistent and already delivering at a level many players have not reached. If this is the foundation, the next chapters of Mbappe’s career will be even more special.
